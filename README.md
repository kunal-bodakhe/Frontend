# Todo Frontend Development Server

A modern todo application frontend built for development and demonstration purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the development server, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.0 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunal-bodakhe/Todo-Frontend
   cd todo-frontend
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install nodemon globally (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```

## Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reloading using nodemon:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or directly with nodemon:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

The server will start on `https://todo-backend-production-a371.up.railway.app/todos` by default.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server with nodemon
- `npm start` - Starts the server in production mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the application for production (if applicable)




## Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
https://todo-frontend-rose-tau.vercel.app/
```
